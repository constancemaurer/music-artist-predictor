## Problem Statement

Can we predict a music artist by his/her songs' spotify music features, popularity score and lyrics?

## Goals

1.
2.


## Methodology 

1. Select artists from a Spotify Dataset published on Kaggle.

2. Retrieve lyrics from artists' songs through Genius API and webscrapping with BeautifulSoup. Alternatively with a Python API wrapper called lyricsgenius by johnwmillr.

3. Establish SQL database

4. Merge datasets.

5. Clean data of missing values, duplicates and other anomalies.

6. Perform sentimental analysis and other NLP analysis to derive NLP-based continous features.

7. Prepare training and testing set.

8. Prepare count and TF-IDF vectorised features.

9. Perform standarisation.

10. *Perform Principal Component Analysis to establish feature importance and reduce the number of features.*

11. *STATSMODELS?*

12. *Cluster Analysis*

13. Model Selection by testing different Classifiers.

14. Model Optimisation and Evaluation with Accuracy, Precision and Recall.

15. Findings and Limitations
